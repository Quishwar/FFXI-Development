# GearSwap Studio
![Build Status](https://github.com/GCarman1982/Development/actions/workflows/gearswap-ui.yml/badge.svg)

GearSwap Studio is a modern, standalone desktop application designed to simplify the creation and management of GearSwap files for Final Fantasy XI (FFXI). It provides a sleek, visual, and interactive way to build gear sets, manage complex job-specific equipment configurations, and seamlessly export your setups directly into functional, ready-to-use Lua scripts—no coding experience necessary.

## Features Overview

### Visual Gear Slot Configurations
Interact with a full grid representing your character's equipment slots to easily equip the right gear for the right situation. 

### Intelligent Item Selector
Instantly search through an integrated database to quickly find items by name, updating your setup seamlessly.

### Dynamic Lua Generation
As you construct your sets, the app generates the precise Lua code required for your GearSwap scripts automatically. It updates in real-time as you switch gear, and even tracks your manual variations.

### Theming
Comfortably use the app in varied lighting conditions with built-in Light and Dark mode themes, or enjoy a blast from the past with the Classic FFXI theme.
