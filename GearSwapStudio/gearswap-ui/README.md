# GearSwap Studio
![Build Status](https://github.com/GCarman1982/Development/actions/workflows/gearswap-ui.yml/badge.svg)

GearSwap Studio is a modern, standalone desktop application designed to simplify the creation and management of GearSwap files for Final Fantasy XI (FFXI). It provides a sleek, visual, and interactive way to build gear sets, manage complex job-specific equipment configurations, and seamlessly export your setups directly into functional, ready-to-use Lua scripts—no coding experience necessary.

## Features Overview

### Import Existing Lua Files
Got an existing GearSwap `.lua` file? No need to start from scratch! GearSwap Studio can import your current files, automatically parsing your sets, character name, and job. This allows you to visually edit your gear and export it back without losing your custom logic or variables.

### Visual Gear Slot Configurations
Interact with a full grid representing your character's equipment slots to easily equip the right gear for the right situation.

### Dynamic Lua Generation
As you construct your sets, the app generates the precise Lua code required for your GearSwap scripts automatically. It updates in real-time as you switch gear, and even tracks your manual variations.
