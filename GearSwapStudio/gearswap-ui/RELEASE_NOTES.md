# GearSwap Studio v1.3.1 Release Notes

We are excited to announce version 1.3.1 of GearSwap Studio! This major update brings a polished desktop experience, robust new manual augment selection, and more intelligent Lua file management capabilities.

## What's New

### 🖥️ Dedicated Desktop Application
We have fully transitioned to a standalone **Electron application** with a refined React/Vite frontend! 
* Your sets are now managed in an isolated desktop environment.
* Added auto-update capabilities so you'll seamlessly receive future enhancements.

### ✨ Intelligent Augment Picker
* Introduced a robust, manual **Augment Picker** component.
* Supports **Drag-and-Drop functionality**: You can now easily reorder your augment lists to perfectly match your gear.
* Select, verify, and input explicit augment values drawn from game data directly within the UI.

### 🛡️ Smart Lua Preservation & Variant Grouping
* Added powerful functionality for **Variant Grouping** for managing sophisticated situational sets.
* Vastly improved Lua serialization: GearSwap Studio now intelligently **preserves your custom Lua variables and logic** when importing and re-exporting.

### 📁 Project Restructure
* Moving forward, the application resides in its new official home under `GearSwapStudio/gearswap-ui`.
